# Project Title: **Regression Analysis for Experimental Data**

## Introduction

This project performs a regression analysis on experimental data using a machine learning model. The goal is to predict experimental values and compare them against actual values using a fitted polynomial regression model. The notebook contains code for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and plotting the results.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and several libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   !pip3 install pandas
   !pip3 install matplotlib
   !pip3 install numpy
   !pip3 install -U scikit-learn
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook ```main.ipynb```

## Data
The data used in this model was obtained from Data Pro


## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter using:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

2. Follow the cells in the notebook to:

- Load and preprocess the data.
- Fit a polynomial regression model.
- Visualize the predicted versus actual values using scatter plots and regression lines.

## Features
- Polynomial regression (degree 1 linear fit) is applied to predict experimental data.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted values with scatter plots.
- Easy-to-understand workflow for model training and evaluation.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

- numpy: for numerical computing and array manipulation.
- matplotlib: for plotting the regression results.
- scikit-learn: for building and evaluating the machine learning model.

# Configuration
No special configuration is needed. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

# Troubleshooting
- If the plots don't display, ensure that matplotlib is installed and that you're running the notebook in an environment that supports graphical output (e.g., JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook).
- If you encounter issues with package installation, check that you are using the correct version of Python and the required libraries.
